      <p> My favourite hobby is reading books because it is fun and reading also helps to gain knowledge. My favourite types of books are Harry Potter series and Sherlock Holmes series. This hobby can be easily developed by anyone, however, I got this naturally. Reading makes us discipline and it is a good source of enjoyment.
